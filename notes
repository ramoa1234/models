time sequence modeling
-make something simple to learn about time sequences 
-try to make an algorithm or model

reinforcement learning?
make a measurement of all the previous price modeling and changes?(mean, average raise or drop)
Make prediction
-mmodel?
fine tune(regression model)

MEAN REVERSION
META LAYERING

correlation coefficent how related the variables are
between 1 high, and -1.
zero means there is no correlation 
covariance which is used in it measure how much they move in the same direction
can be done in batches

for each variable in a row
measure the covariance between the value estimated value and teh return 

CHECK CORRELATION BETWEEN EACH OF THE FACTORS TO ENSURE THEY ARE ZERO
indicating that the changes in the factors and results are random and there is no pattern
you can measure between them

REGRESSION = how much a change in one value affects another
regression procedures

get correlation between 
factor and residual want them to be 0

cov
take previous residual
and 
factor
divide by the multiplcation of there std div

measure correlation between 5 values
if you measure two close you no data you cannot measure a patter in 3 changes needs to be more

set intervals for correlation. Find a patter in each bach
correlation is done in matrices
linear regeression is just trying to find linear patters in a in matrices or times

for each row
    index / 5 % 2
        curr array - 5
        get corr of those values
