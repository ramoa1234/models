pytorch
requires an understand of how the functions in the model work and how to tweak them and train


STRUCTURE
create a random forest model uses a linaer model 





structure explination
creates a random forest model that works by taking in random times and creating trees for them to properly make measurements without randomness
Using some linear model to create the tress

random forest tree works by creating ranges of data?(if vol this much and prev price was this much to make tree that can be used to predict)
